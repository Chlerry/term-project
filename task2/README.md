2.a
As the result shown in the figure, PSNR increases as the P value increases.

2.b
As the P value increases, the image visualized quality gets better because higher P value means lower compression ratio. In other words, higher compression ration comes with lower image quality. For the same P value, the decode difficulty becomes harder as the number of image elements increases. For example, 'Lee' on the t-shirt in the second image and streaks on the t-shirt in the eighth image.
