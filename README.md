Term Project

This document is a report for three tasks in the term-project. 
The first task is to calculate the recognition accuracy rate and show the confusion matrix for a Convolutional Neural Network for the recognition task with the fashion MNIST data set.
The second task is to implement an image compression system using a Neural Network, then calculate and analyze the result of the average PSNR values of the test set for three different ùëÉ values. 
The third task is to build a color video compression system with two different Convolutional Neural Networks, and experiment a Generative Adversarial Network in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.
